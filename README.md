## Introduction:

**Artistic Fusion**, is a image style transfer model base on CycleGAN and Stable Diffusion. At its core, CycleGAN establishes a reliable base for style accuracy, which is then significantly enhanced through our diffusion model adaptations. Classifier-guided and classifier-free guiance methods play a crucial role, enriched further by the integration of text-driven large diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion. Additionally, a pivotal exploration into the efficacy of superresolution models elevates the final output to high-resolutions, achieving remarkable clarity and details. Our comprehensive methodology and rigorous experiments have led to promis-ing results, achieving competitive performance in FID and LPIPS evaluation metrics, and possess aesthetic and artistic purity.

In essence, **Arsistic Fusion** is more than an addition to the compendium of image style transfer methods; it is an approach that aligns the human kind's aesthetic and artistic cravings with modern intricate style transfer technologies.

ü§ó Please cite [BLIP BeaconSaliency](https://github.com/Learner209/) in your publications if it helps with your work. Please starüåü this repo to help others notice AugmentIQ if you think it is useful. It really means a lot to our open-source research. Thank you! BTW, you may also like [`BLIP`](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP), [`pysaliency`](https://github.com/matthias-k/pysaliency), the two great open-source repositories upon which we built our architecture.

> üì£ Attention please: <br> > **BLIP BeaconSaliency** is developed under the framework of [pysaliency](https://github.com/matthias-k/pysaliency), a Python toolbox for predicting visual saliency maps and is pre-configured with several datasets and matlab-implemented models. An example of using pysaliency for predicting SJTU-VIS dataset is shown below. With [pysaliency](https://github.com/matthias-k/pysaliency), easy peasy! üòâ

## ‚ùñ Contributions and Performance

‚¶ø **`Contributions`**:

1.  Our model innovatively explores text-guided saliency, an area previously under-researched. It focuses on how textual prompts affect visual saliency map prediction, advancing the field‚Äôs boundaries.
2.  The architecture integrates BERT and GradCam. BERT excels in aligning text and image features, while GradCam effectively draws saliency maps using esti- mated gradient flows. Their combination enhances model performance on various metrics.
3.  Our model achieves better and consistent results, comparable to state-of-the-art models across several metrics like sAUC, AUC, SSIM, CC, confirming its efficacy.

‚¶ø **`Performance`**: **BLIP BeaconSaliency** outperforms various models on several saliency benchmarks, especially in datset SJTU-VIS.

## ‚ùñ Brief Graphical Illustration of Our Methodology

Here we only show the main component of our method: the joint-optimization training approach combining three encoders while frozening their own weights.
For the detailed description and explanation, please read our full paper if you are interested.

## ‚ùñ Repository Structure

The implementation of **BLIP BeaconSaliency** is in dir [`blipsaliency`](https://github.com/Learner209/text-guided-saliency).Please install it via `pip install -e .` or `python setup.py install`. Due to the time and resource limit, we haven't performed extensive enough parameter finetuning experiments, if you like this repo, plek and PR to help us improve it ! üíö üíõ ü§é.

## ‚ùñ Development Environment

We run on `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS` with a system configured with a NVIDIA RTX A40 GPU.

-   Use conda to create a env for **BLIP BeaconSaliency** and activate it.

```bash
conda env create --file=enviornment.yaml
conda activate blipsaliency
```

-   Then install **blipsaliency** as a package

```
cd blipsaliency
pip install -e .
```

Additionally, if you want to reproduce the results about the gradient-based models in the paper(extensive experiments on Vanilla Gradient, SmoothGrad, Integrated gradients, GradCam... based on InceptionV3, CNN or MLP architectures), please refer to the sanity-check directory !ü§ó

To follow the original implementation of these gradient-based models, we have to create a new conda environment to test it!

```bash
conda env create --file=tf_env.yaml
conda activate sanity
```

Also, if you want to see how I process the SJTU-VIS dataset inot to hdf5 format and integrate them into the pysaliency framework, please refer to the pysaliency directory and more specifically, the file, (and we are planning to give a PR to the original pysaliency repo since SJTU-VIS is an awesome dataset integrated with the power of textual prompts) !üòé

## ‚ùñ Datasets

We run on nine datasets, more specifically, MIT1003(MIT300), SJTU-VIS, CAT2000, FIGRIM, SALICON, Toronto, DUT-OMRON, OSIE, PASCAL-S, NUSEF-Public.

Here are some samples taken randomly from the dataset:
